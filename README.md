## Dataset Structure

The dataset is provided in **JSON** format with an array of objects, where each object represents a railway station.

### Example JSON Format:

```json
[
  {
    "station_code": "A",
    "station_name": "ARMENIAN GHAT CITY",
    "region_code": "SE"
  },
  {
    "station_code": "AA",
    "station_name": "ATARIA",
    "region_code": "NE"
  },
  {
    "station_code": "AABH",
    "station_name": "AMBIKA BHAWALI HALT",
    "region_code": "EC"
  }
]
```

## Keys in the JSON:

- **station_code**: A unique identifier for each railway station (e.g., "A", "AA", "AABH").
- **station_name**: The name of the railway station (e.g., "ARMENIAN GHAT CITY", "ATARIA").
- **region_code**: The region to which the station belongs (e.g., "SE", "NE", "EC").

## Usage

You can use this dataset for:

- **Transportation Analysis**: Analyze railway stations' distribution, connectivity, and regional coverage.
- **Geographic Studies**: Map railway stations across India using their coordinates and regional data.
- **Machine Learning**: Incorporate station data in predictive models or recommendation systems related to transportation.
- **Mapping and Visualization**: Visualize Indian railway stations and their connections in geographical mapping software.

## Example of how to load the dataset:

If you want to load and use the dataset in **Python** (using `json` module), here's how you can do it:

```python
import json

# Load the JSON dataset
with open('railway_stations_india.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

# Display the first few stations
for station in data[:5]:  # Displaying first 5 stations
    print(f"Station Code: {station['station_code']}, Station Name: {station['station_name']}, Region Code: {station['region_code']}")

```
